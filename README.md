# Task Manager Api

This application has the ability to maintain record of the tasks created the application users. An user can also create, view, update and delete their own tasks.
User can also upload their profile pictures and view those.

Security is the top-most priority in this app. Hence, its the most focused feature and has been implemented using JWT tokens.
